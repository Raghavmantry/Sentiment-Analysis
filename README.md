# Sentiment Analysis ML Model Project

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis ML Model Project! This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on text data to determine the sentiment, whether it's positive, neutral, or negative. The project includes a machine learning model for sentiment analysis, data preprocessing steps, and a web-based frontend to interact with the model.

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing and determining the sentiment expressed in text. This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify text as positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. The goal is to help businesses understand social sentiment around their brand, products, or services.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have completed the installation steps.
2. Run the script `app.py` to start the Flask application.
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the frontend.

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps involve:
1. Tokenizing the text.
2. Converting text to lowercase.
3. Removing stopwords and punctuation.
4. Applying stemming.
5. Sequential modeling.

## Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model is a sentiment analysis model trained to classify text sentiment. The model uses a preprocessed dataset and employs a deep learning architecture, such as LSTM, to predict sentiment.

## Frontend
The frontend is a web-based interface that allows users to input text and receive sentiment predictions. It provides an intuitive way to interact with the sentiment analysis model. The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
